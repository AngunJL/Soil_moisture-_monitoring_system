# Project ENG-496 Group R1 (Soil moisture monitoring system)

## 📖Overviews📖
This project uses a Soil Moisture Sensor to measure the moisture level in the soil.
The collected data is sent to a Dashboard via an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi, 
allowing users to monitor the soil condition in real time and decide when to water their plants.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The Soil Moisture Sensor reads the soil moisture level.

2. The data is sent to the ESP32 / Raspberry Pi.

3. The microcontroller processes the data and uploads it to the Dashboard.

4. Users can view the data in real time and receive alerts when the soil is too dry.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Connect the Soil Moisture Sensor to ESP32 or Raspberry Pi.

2. Upload the provided example code (Arduino IDE for ESP32 / Python for Raspberry Pi).

3. Configure Wi-Fi and Dashboard settings.

4. Start monitoring soil moisture in real time.
