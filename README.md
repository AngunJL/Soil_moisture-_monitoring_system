# Project ENG-496 Group R1 (Soil moisture)

OverviewsðŸ“–
This project uses a Soil Moisture Sensor to measure the moisture level in the soil.
The collected data is sent to a Dashboard via an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi, 
allowing users to monitor the soil condition in real time and decide when to water their plants.
